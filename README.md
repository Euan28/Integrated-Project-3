# Integrated-Project-3

An example of one of the most challenging yet rewarding times during my studies was during a group project where several of us designed and 
developed a UK-based pollution tracking system. This project proved to be quite difficult due to the merging of the several developed sections 
of the application. However, due to our persistence and communications skills, we were able to produce a completed application that resulted 
in one of the highest graded projects.
